## Resources Structure

Instead of duplicating information, this repository follows a structured approach:

1. **Main README.md**: Overall project description and entry point
2. **Sub-directory READMEs**: Specific information related to that directory's contents
3. **Resource Files**: Cheatsheets and reference materials for common tasks
4. **Configuration Files**: Standard files that can be used as templates

This structure ensures information is organized logically without unnecessary duplication.
